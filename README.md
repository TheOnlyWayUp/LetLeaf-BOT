`LetLeaf` is a discord bot programmed purely in python...
I can no more focus on documentation coz the bot needs some final touches...
Any help is appreciated!!!

## The Bot itself is completely ready...
## The only main thing left is ***Documentation***.
## If you want to tryout the bot, please feel free to get it connected [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=840807839182225409&permissions=1425501271&scope=bot) and please do not forget to feedback me the issues or new ideas about the bot
